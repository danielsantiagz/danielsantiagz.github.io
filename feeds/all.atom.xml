This means that the author is putting himself down right off the bat. My name is Daniel Santiago. I would like to say that I am a security enthusiast. I enjoy most things related to cyber security. I've wanted to start a blog since a few years ago (check my github to see the first time i commited the welcom.gd for my page, it's sad) but I never got the courage to start posting up until now. I don't guarantee that I'll keep posting regularly but I think this is the first step. I intend to write about my experiences as a "bacalao" working as a pentester and the techniques I learn along the way. Maybe think of this blog as my public digital journal.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>

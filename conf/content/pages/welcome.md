  <p> My name is Daniel Santiago-Rodríguez. I'm a Computer Science graduate from the <a href="http://uprrp.edu/">University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus</a>. I used to work as the Systems Administrator for the <a href="http://ccom.uprrp.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> at the university. I finished my Bachelor's degree in december of 2016. I work as a pentester for <a href="https://www.gmsectec.com/">GM Security Technologies</a> since january 2017.</p>

  <p>I would like to say that I'm a "security enthusiast" and I believe that is the topic that interests me the most. I have participated in a few "Capture the Flag" events and even prepared some my self. I specially like to teach people about security. I worked as an instructor in the <a href="http://atackpr.ccom.uprrp.edu/index.php?page=summer-camp">ATACKPR HS-Summercamp</a>. I developed course exercises and taught the material to the students. I developed pentesting demo's for the students and I prepared a "Capture the Flag" for the students to participate in. </p>

  <p>I have recently decided to try and keep up with a personal webpage/blog where I will try and post articles, blog posts, resources and even try to post "write ups/tutorial" for a few "Capture the Flag exercises" that I find interesting.</p>

  <p>I'm also a sport climber. Maybe I'll post a few things about that :)</p>

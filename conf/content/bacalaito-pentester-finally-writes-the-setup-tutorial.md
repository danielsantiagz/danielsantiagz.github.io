After giving a talk I promised the students that attended that I was going to write a tutorial on how to setup the lab exactly as I had it so they could test what I did. After almost two weeks I finally did. [Go here](http://bacalaitopentester.com/pages/mr-robot-lab-setup.html) to setup the lab and to get the other instructions go to my [previous post](http://bacalaitopentester.com/bacalaito-pentester-gives-a-workshop.html) so you can download my writeup and get the 3 keys for the VM. If you get stuck you can always contact me. I hope you enjoy and teach someone else what you learn.

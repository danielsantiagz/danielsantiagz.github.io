So I was invited by my friend to give a talk at the university from which I graduated. I hate public speaking but I love cybersecurity so much that I do to just to teach the things I've learned along the way. I like to consider my self as an active member of the cybersecurity club for the Department of Computer Science of the University of Puerto Rico, RÃ­o Piedras Campus even though I don't attend the meetings. I gave a few workshops as a student. I decided to recycle a really cool workshop that I gave when I was a student to motivate new members with cybersecurity since it's really flashy with simple but effective techniques that are easy to learn. I use the ["Mr-Robot: 1"](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/mr-robot-1,151/) virtual machine from vulnhub.com. I'm a little nervous since it's been a long time since I've given a talk and because I think most of the people from the club won't know me. I decided to post the writeup for the exercise but since the python markdown extension is giving me a headache (it doesn't support nested code blocks) I exported the markdown to a pdf available [here](/pdfs/mrR0b0+.pdf). I should write a post on how to setup the workshop but the horrors that I've endured working on this workshop have given me nightmares and I don't want to think about it for a while (note to self: don't wait 2 days before the workshop to prepare, specially if you haven't updated the laptop you're going to use for about a year because everything will go wrong  \*\*wait for a future post\*\* )
